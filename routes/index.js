						For grammatical reasons, documents are going to use different forms of a word, such as <I>"organize"</I>, <I>"organizes"</I>, and <I>"organizing"</I>.  
						Additionally, there are families of derivationally related words with similar meanings, such as <I>"democracy"</I>, <I>"democratic"</I>, and <I>"democratization"</I>.
						The goal of both stemming and lemmatization is to reduce inflectional forms and sometimes derivationally related forms of a word to a common base form.<br><br>

						for discovering the abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of documents. Topic modeling is a frequently used text-mining 
						tool for discovery of hidden semantic structures in a text body. Intuitively, given that a document is about a particular topic, 
						one would expect particular words to appear in the document more or less frequently: "dog" and "bone" will appear more often in documents about dogs,
						"cat" and "meow" will appear in documents about cats, and "the" and "is" will appear equally in both. A document typically concerns multiple topics 
						in different proportions; thus, in a document that is 10% about cats and 90% about dogs, there would probably be about 9 times more dog words than cat words. 
						The "topics" produced by topic modeling techniques are clusters of similar words.<br><br>`},
