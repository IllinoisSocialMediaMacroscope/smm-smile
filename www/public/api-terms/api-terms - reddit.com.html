You agree that you will protect this confidential information from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that you would use to protect your own confidential and proprietary information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.  Reddit confidential information does not include information that you independently developed, that was rightfully given to you by a third party without confidentiality obligation, or that becomes public through no fault of your own. You may disclose Reddit confidential information when compelled to do so by law if you provide us reasonable prior notice, unless a court orders that we not receive notice.

b.  Modification to these Terms.  Reddit may modify the Terms or any portion to, at any time. You should look at the Terms regularly. We'll post notice of modifications to the Terms within the documentation of each applicable API or to this website.  By continuing to access or use the Reddit APIs after modifications or revisions to the Terms become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised or modified Terms.  

c.  General.  These Terms do not create any agency, partnership or joint venture between the parties.  Nothing in the Terms will limit either party's ability to seek injunctive relief.  Reddit is not liable for failure or delay in performance to the extent caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control.  Any failure to enforce any provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver thereof or of any other provision.  If any section (or portion of a section) of these Terms is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the rest of the Terms will remain in effect.  These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflict of laws principles.  For any dispute relating to these Terms, the parties consent to personal jurisdiction and exclusive venue in San Francisco County, California.  These Terms are the entire agreement between you and Reddit relating to its subject and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements on that subject.
